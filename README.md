# Ensemble Learning using base model ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0

Welcome to the ensemble learning project using ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0! This project demonstrates how to combine predictions from these models using ensemble techniques for Corn Leaf Disease Detection.

## Installation and Usage

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafikusdiarto/build-ensemblemodel
```

```bash
cd build-ensemblemodel
```

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. If you haven't installed `venv`, you can install it using:

```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment named venv:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
./venv/Scripts/activate 
```

### Install Dependencies and Run Projects

Install the required packages using pip and the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Voila you can run ipynb in your local server ðŸ¤™, 
Make sure your laptop specifications are qualified, it looks like this machine learning model is a bit heavy ðŸ˜Š

## Let's try it!
This project is my final assignment for my bachelor's degree !!!, Really Love Machine Learning, Machine Learning Is Future ðŸ˜˜
